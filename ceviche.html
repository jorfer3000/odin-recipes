    <p>Ceviche is a refreshing and vibrant seafood dish popular in coastal regions of Latin America, especially in Peru, where it is considered a national dish. This delicacy is typically made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices, such as lime or lemon, and spiced with ají or chili peppers. Additional seasonings such as onion, salt, and cilantro are added to enhance the flavor.</p>

    <p>The result is a light and tangy dish that's often accompanied by sides like sweet potato, lettuce, corn, or avocado. Ceviche is celebrated for its simplicity and its ability to showcase the fresh flavors of the seafood.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh firm white fish (e.g., sea bass, halibut), cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>Juice of 10 limes</li>
        <li>1 red onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1-2 ají peppers, seeded and finely chopped, or substitute with jalapeño peppers</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional garnishes: sliced avocado, boiled sweet potato, or popcorn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the fish in a glass or ceramic bowl, and pour over the lime juice, ensuring that the fish is completely submerged. The acidity of the lime juice will begin to "cook" the fish.</li>
        <li>Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes, until the fish becomes opaque and slightly firm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced red onion, cilantro, and chopped peppers to the fish. Mix well and season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Let the ceviche marinate for an additional 10 minutes in the refrigerator before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve chilled, garnished with your choice of avocado, sweet potato, or popcorn, and enjoy the fresh, tangy flavors of your homemade ceviche.</li>
    </ol>
