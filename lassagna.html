    <p>Lasagna, a beloved staple in Italian cuisine, is a dish that combines the rich flavors of layered pasta, savory meats, and creamy cheeses. Originating from the region of Emilia-Romagna, traditional lasagna is made with layers of flat lasagna noodles, Bolognese sauce (a slow-cooked meat sauce), and béchamel, a white sauce. Each layer is generously sprinkled with Parmigiano-Reggiano, creating a deliciously indulgent meal that's perfect for gatherings and family dinners.</p>

    <p>Today, lasagna has evolved into numerous variations that cater to different tastes and dietary preferences. From vegetarian options that include layers of roasted vegetables and ricotta, to contemporary twists like seafood or chicken lasagna, there’s a version for everyone. This versatility makes lasagna not only a comfort food favorite but also a canvas for creativity in the kitchen, inviting cooks to explore new combinations and flavors.</p>
