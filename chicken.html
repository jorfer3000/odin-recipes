    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (about 4 to 5 pounds)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs (like rosemary and thyme) for stuffing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).</li>
        <li>Rinse the chicken under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. This will help the skin get extra crispy.</li>
        <li>Rub the olive oil all over the chicken. In a small bowl, mix the salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and thyme. Sprinkle this seasoning mixture evenly over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Stuff the cavity of the chicken with the lemon halves, smashed garlic cloves, and fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a roasting pan and roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for at least 10 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring the chicken is moist and flavorful.</li>
    </ol>
